        <div class="introduction text-content">
            <p>Granola bars are one of the most convenient foods. They're full of whole ingredients that are packed into a portable snack ready to go with you wherever, whenever.</p>
            <p>Sure, there are a bunch of bars you can find at the store, but there are a ton of benefits to making your own. You can control the sweetness, come up with your own combinations of flavors, and control what ingredients you're adding into your bars. Once you master a versatile recipe like this one, the sky's the limit.</p>
            <h2>Mix-Ins for Homemade Granola Bars</h2>
            <p>This recipe uses 3/4 cup almonds, 3/4 cup pumpkin seeds, 1/2 cup dried cherries, and 1/2 cup unsweetened coconut flakes. Use whatever combination of mix-ins you'd like as long as the total amount is around 2 1/2 cups. If any of your ingredients are on the larger side like almonds, pecans, or dried apricots give them a rough chop before adding them in.</p>
            <p> Here are some ingredient ideas to spark your creativity:
                <ul>
                    <li>Nuts: almonds, walnuts, peanuts, hazelnuts, cashews, pecans</li>

                    <li>Other ingredients: coconut flakes, chocolate chips, M&Ms or other candy</li>
                </ul>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Preheat oven and prepare baking pan:</strong>
                    <p>Preheat the oven to 325°F.</p>
                    <p>Line a 9x9 inch baking pan with parchment paper, leaving enough overhang on 2 opposite sides to form a “sling.” You will use the overhang to lift the bars out of the pan once they have cooled.</p>

                </li>
                <li><strong>Combine the dry ingredients:</strong>
                    <p>In a large bowl, stir together the oats, oat flour, salt, and cinnamon until well combined.</p>

                    <p>In a small saucepan over medium heat combine the almond butter, coconut oil, honey, and corn syrup using a heat proof spatula.</p>
                    <p>Bring to a simmer, stirring occasionally. Continue to simmer for 1 minute, stirring constantly to ensure the nut butter does not burn. Remove from heat and stir in the vanilla extract.</p>

                    <p>Pour the wet ingredients over the oat mixture. Use a rubber spatula to combine until everything is fully coated.</p>
                    <p>Transfer the granola mixture to the parchment-lined baking pan. Place a piece of parchment paper on top of the mixture and use your hands to spread and press it evenly into the pan. Using the bottom of a cup, firmly press the mixture down until it is even, flat, and compact. Remove the top piece of parchment.</p>

                <li><strong>Chill:</strong>
                    <p>Remove pan from the oven place on a cooling rack for about 30 minutes. Then transfer the pan uncovered to the fridge for another 30 minutes.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Cut and enjoy:</strong>
                    <p>Use the parchment sling to transfer the granola to a cutting board. Using a chef's knife, cut into 12 bars (one cut down the center and 5 cuts across).</p>
