        <h2>Buckeye Pancakes</h2>
        <p>Our buckeye pancakes have peanut butter mixed in the batter and a healthy portion of chocolate chips dimpling the surface. I also add honey to mimic the texture and taste of syrup, without having to bother with serving it on the side. Though if you want more sweetness, no one ever suffered from an extra pour of warm syrup. </p>
        <h2>Peanut Butter and Chocolate Chip Pancakes Variations</h2>
        <p>This is a super flexible recipe, which is part of its appeal. The main components can be tweaked or elevated to your heart's desire. 
            <ul>
                <li>Use maple syrup or agave syrup instead of honey.</li>
                <li>A dash of cinnamon would play nicely with the flavors.</li>
                <li>You can use PB2, a powdered peanut butter instead of the creamy peanut butter. Use the same amount and cut back the honey by 1 teaspoon. Since this is a powder versus a spread, you may want to add a touch of oil or milk to loosen the batter.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

            </li>
            <li><strong>Cook the pancakes:</strong>
                <p>In a large skillet or griddle set to medium heat, add about 1/2 tablespoon butter. Pour a heaping tablespoon of batter in at a time, making silver dollar-sized pancakes. Leave plenty of space in between each pancake. </p>
                <p>Cook for 2 to 3 minutes, then flip. They are ready to flip when small bubbles appear on top and the edges start to brown. Cook the other side for 2 to 3 minutes. Add more butter to the skillet as needed.</p>

            <li><strong>Serve:</strong>
                <p>Serve the pancakes immediatelyâ€”syrup is optional for these sweet pancakes! </p>
                <p>Cool leftovers and refrigerate in an airtight container for a day or two. You can reheat them briefly in a toaster oven or let them warm to room temperature and eat them that way.</p>
